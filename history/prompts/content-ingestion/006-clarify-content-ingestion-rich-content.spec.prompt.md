## Prompt

@[/sp-clarify]

## Response snapshot

Clarified ambiguous ingestion rules:
1. **Exclude** generated pages (`/tags/`, `/authors/`) from sitemap.
2. **Preserve & Oversize** rich content (large tables/code blocks) instead of strict token splitting.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Prevented index pollution and preserved code block integrity
- 🧪 Tests: FR-001 and FR-003 updated to be testable
- 📁 Files: 1 modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp-plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Proactive clarification on rich content is crucial for technical documentation RAG.
