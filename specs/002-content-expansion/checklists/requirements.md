- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated by Agent.
- "Docusaurus 3.9" constraint in Assumptions is acceptable as it is an existing project constraint.
- "Mermaid.js" in FR-004 is a specific requirement for visual consistency/maintainability, acceptable.
