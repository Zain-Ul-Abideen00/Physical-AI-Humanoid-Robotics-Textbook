# Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, we will explore the foundational concepts of the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions).
- Install and configure ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04.
- Create your first ROS 2 workspace and package.
- Write simple Publisher/Subscriber nodes in Python and C++.

## Chapters

1. **[Introduction to ROS 2](./chapters/01-intro.md)**: What is it and why do we use it?
2. **[Installation & Setup](./chapters/02-installation.md)**: Getting your environment ready.
3. **[Writing Code](./chapters/04-writing-code.md)**: Creating your first nodes.

## Labs

- Lab 1.1: Environment Setup
- Lab 1.2: Talker/Listener Node

## Summary

In this module, we've laid the groundwork for your robotics journey. You now understand why ROS 2 is the industry standard and have a working environment to build upon.

## What's Next?

Now that you have ROS 2 installed, it's time to understand the core concepts of [Nodes and Topics](./chapters/01-intro.md).
