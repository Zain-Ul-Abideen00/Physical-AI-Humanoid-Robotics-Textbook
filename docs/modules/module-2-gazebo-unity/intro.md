# Module 2: Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin)

Welcome to Module 2! This module focuses on simulation and the concept of the "Digital Twin".

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of simulation in robotics development.
- Work with Gazebo for physics-based simulation.
- Integrate ROS 2 with Gazebo using `ros_gz`.
- Introduction to Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## Chapters

1. **[Simulation Basics](./chapters/01-simulation-basics.md)**: Why simulate?
2. **[Gazebo World File](./chapters/02-gazebo-world.md)**: Your physics playground.

## Labs

- Lab 2.1: Spawning a Robot in Gazebo
- Lab 2.2: Controlling a Simulated Robot via ROS 2

## Summary

Simulation allows us to test hypotheses and train AI without risking expensive hardware.

## What's Next?

Let's start by understanding the core concepts of [Simulation Basics](./chapters/01-simulation-basics.md).
