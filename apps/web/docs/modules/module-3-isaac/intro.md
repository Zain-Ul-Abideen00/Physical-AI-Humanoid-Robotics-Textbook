# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (AI-Robot Brain)

Welcome to Module 3! Here we dive into the "Brain" of the robot using NVIDIA Isaac.

## Learning Objectives

- Overview of the NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS).
- Using GPU-accelerated algorithms for perception.
- Introduction to Isaac Gym for reinforcement learning.

## Chapters

1. **[NVIDIA Isaac Overview](./chapters/01-isaac-overview.md)**: The AI Robotics Platform.
2. **[Isaac Python API](./chapters/02-isaac-api.md)**: Controlling the simulation.

## Labs

- Lab 3.1: Running Isaac Sim
- Lab 3.2: Object Detection with Isaac ROS

## Summary

NVIDIA Isaac accelerates robotics development by providing GPU-optimized tools for both simulation and runtime perception.
